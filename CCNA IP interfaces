In this i will show you that how you can see how many interfaces(ports) are connected or not connected to the Router in Command line interface on packet traser.
first you need to enter in the privileged  Exact mode
Router>enable
Router#                                                 : This show that we are in priveleged exact mode
Router#conf t                                           : This command is used for global configuration in this we do operation on Router
Router(config)#do show ip interface brief               : This command is used for show ip interfaces or port that are connected on the router
Interface              IP-Address      OK?   Method  Status                Protocol 
GigabitEthernet0/0/0   unassigned      YES   unset   administratively     down down 
GigabitEthernet0/0/1   unassigned      YES   unset   administratively     down down 
GigabitEthernet0/0/2   unassigned      YES   unset   administratively     down down 
Vlan1                  unassigned      YES   unset   administratively     down down

They all are unassigned and unset and down because i didnt enter any single port or interface in it
